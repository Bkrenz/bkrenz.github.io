# Robert Krency

Hello!

I am currently a Junior at the California University of Pennsylvania (CalU), studying Computer Science. 
My interests primarily lie in theoretical computer science, high performance computing, and the bridge between mathematics and computing. 
For the past 8 years I have been running my family's small diner, while teaching myself as much as I can about software development.
I decided to continue my formal education at CalU in Computer Science, and expect to graduate Spring 2023.
I hope to continue my education beyond that with a focus on mathematics and computing.

A primary side project has been learning LaTeX, through which I have been writing (and re-writing) my course notes and work.
The fruits of my labor can be found in the repositories linked below.

I utilize GitHub as a way to collaborate, demonstrate, and sync my work with my classmates and colleagues.
Always looking for work and interesting project collaborations!


## Projects

### [Minimum Dominating Sets](https://github.com/Bkrenz/calu-csc360/tree/main/Assignments/Minimum%20Dominating%20Set)
This was an exploration into complexity theory.
The problem is a formulation of the Vertex Cover problem, of which an optimal solution can only be found by checking all sets of nodes in which the problem set grows with a complexity O(2^n).
This is meant to be a demonstration of how finding an optimal solution to a given problem can cause running time to grow exponentially fast.
Experiments with this implementation showed a 40+ hour runtime with a graph of 37 nodes with random connections.


### Comment Anywhere (WIP)

Comment Anywhere is the result of a Senior Software Engineering team project.
It takes the form of a Browser Extension, and displays user submitted comments alongside web pages.
This product was developed with the ideology that discussions about web content are entirely divorced from the content and kept to third party websites such as Facebook, Reddit, or other social media.

A prototype is currently being developed, but the accompanying documentation is listed below.
