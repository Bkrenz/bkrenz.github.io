# Robert Krency

Hello!

I am currently a Junior at the California University of Pennsylvania (CalU), studying Computer Science. 
My interests primarily lie in theoretical computer science, high performance computing, and the bridge between mathematics and computing. 
For the past 8 years I have been running my family's small diner, while teaching myself as much as I can about software development.
I decided to continue my formal education at CalU in Computer Science, and expect to graduate Spring 2023.
I hope to continue my education beyond that with a focus on mathematics and computing.

A primary side project has been learning LaTeX, through which I have been writing (and re-writing) my course notes and work.
The fruits of my labor can be found in the repositories linked below.

I utilize GitHub as a way to collaborate, demonstrate, and sync my work with my classmates and colleagues.
Always looking for work and interesting project collaborations!
